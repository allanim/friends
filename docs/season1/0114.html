<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> No! Phoebes! Don&apos;t you remember why you dumped the guy?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> &apos;Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it&apos;s nice to have a date on Valentine&apos;s Day!</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> No, no, no, don&apos;t you dare bail on me. The only reason she&apos;s goin&apos; out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Pathetic mess? I know, but&#x2014;come on, man, she&apos;s needy, she&apos;s vulnerable. I&apos;m thinkin&apos;, cha-ching! (Rachel throws a roll at Joey. He picks it up and eats it.) Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You&apos;re doin&apos; this.</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Which one was Pete Carney?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. (imitating) &quot;Was it good for you?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Yeah, well, I&apos;ll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-&quot;I-win&quot;-guy. (imitating) &quot;I win! I win!&quot; I went out with the guy for two months&#x2014;I didn&apos;t get to win once.</p>

<p><strong>Janice:</strong> By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> That&apos;s OK.</p>
<p><strong>Janice:</strong> Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Excuse me. (gets up, jumps up and down while he zips his zipper up... other patrons look at him) How ya doin&apos;?</p>
<p><strong>Janice:</strong> So, do we have the best friends or what?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Joey&apos;s not a friend. He&apos;s...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?</p>

Um, what&apos;s say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you&apos;re gonna say, you&apos;re a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let&apos;s just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we&apos;re great together, you know. You can&apos;t deny it. Besides, you&apos;re carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that?
