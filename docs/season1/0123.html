<h4 id="scene-the-hospital-ross-rachel-chandler-joey-and-monica-are-in-the-waiting-room-waiting-for-carol-and-susan-to-arrive">[Scene: The hospital, Ross, Rachel, Chandler, Joey, and Monica are in the waiting room, waiting for Carol and Susan to arrive.]</h4>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> She&apos;s not here yet. She&apos;s not here. She&apos;s having my baby and she&apos;s not here.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> I&apos;m sure everything&apos;s fine. Has her water broke yet?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> I don&apos;t know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug.</p>
<p>(Joey makes a sound of absolute disgust.)</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Do we have to know about that?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> I&apos;m gonna be in the waitin&apos; room, handing out cigars.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Yes, Joey&apos;s made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50&apos;s.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> God, I don&apos;t believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh, Ross, relax. It&apos;s probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.</p>
<p>(Everyone looks at Rachel as though she made a tasteless comment.)</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> What, it&apos;s ok when Chandler does it?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> You have to pick your moments.</p>
<p>(Phoebe arrives, guitar in hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Did I miss it, did I miss it?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> She&apos;s not even here yet.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> What&apos;s with the guitar?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical.</p>
<p>(Carol and Susan arrive.)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (to Carol) Where the hell have you been?</p>
<p><strong>Susan:</strong> We stopped at the gift shop.</p>
<p><strong>Carol:</strong> I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a <em>Chunky</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Susan wanted a <em>Chunky</em>. We&apos;re having a baby, ok, a baby, you don&apos;t stop for _Chunky_s.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> I used to have that bumper sticker.</p>
<p>(Everyone is amused by Chandler&apos;s comment.)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> (to Rachel) You see what I mean.</p>

<p><strong>Nurse:</strong> Out!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Franzblau:</strong> All right, he&apos;s crowning. Here he comes.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it&apos;s, it&apos;s huge. Carol, how are you doing this?</p>
<p><strong>Carol:</strong> (straining) Not.... helping!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Franzblau:</strong> You&apos;re doing great, you&apos;re doing fine.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (puts his head near the baby) Hello! (to Dr. Franzblau) Oh, sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Susan:</strong> What do you see? What do you see?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It&apos;s a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He&apos;s here. He&apos;s a person.</p>
<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Oh, look at that.</p>
<p><strong>Carol:</strong> What does he look like?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in <em>Jell-o</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Carol:</strong> Really?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> (from the air vent overhead) You guys, he&apos;s beautiful!</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Oh, thanks, Pheebs!</p>
<p>(They look up towards the vent and wave at Phoebe.)</p>
<h4 id="scene-the-delivery-room-carol-is-holding-the-infant">[Scene: The Delivery Room, Carol is holding the infant.]</h4>
<p><strong>Susan:</strong> No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (thinking) How &apos;bout Ben?</p>
<p><strong>Susan:</strong> I like Ben.</p>
<p><strong>Carol:</strong> Ben. Ben. Ben&apos;s good. How come you never mentioned Ben before?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> We uh, we just cooked it up.</p>
<p><strong>Susan:</strong> That&apos;s what we were off doing.</p>
<p>(Monica opens the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Hi.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Can we come in?</p>
<p>(The whole gang enters.)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (to Ben) I know, I know. Everybody, there&apos;s someone I&apos;d like you to meet. Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Susan, he looks just like you.</p>
<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh, god, I can&apos;t believe one of us actually has one of these.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> I know, I still am one of these.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Ross, can I?</p>
<p>(Monica holds Ben.)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> The head, the head. You gotta...</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> (getting choked up) Hi, Ben. Hi. I&apos;m your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I&apos;m your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.</p>

<h4 id="scene-the-hospital-the-camera-is-placed-as-though-it-were-bens-eyes">[Scene: The Hospital, the camera is placed as though it were Ben&apos;s eyes.]</h4>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. (walks out of the picture) But I&apos;ll still always come back, like this. (returns) And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. (walks away) But I&apos;ll still always come back, like this. (returns)</p>
<p>(Chandler comes into the picture.)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> And sometimes, I&apos;ll want you to steal third, and I&apos;ll go like this. (Does a baseball sign.)</p>
<p>(The rest of the group come into the picture.)</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> He is so amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh, I know. Look at him.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don&apos;t think that&apos;s his name.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Oh, look, look, he&apos;s closing his eyes. (screen goes blank) Look, he&apos;s opening his eyes. (picture comes back)</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> He doesn&apos;t do much, does he?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> No, this is pretty much it.</p>
<p>(long moment of silence)</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> You guys wanna get some coffee?</p>
<p><strong>All:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> All right, I&apos;ll see you guys later.</p>
<p>(They all leave but Ross, but they all come back a few seconds later. They make faces at the baby.)</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Oh, look, he&apos;s closing his eyes again.</p>
<p>(The screen fades to black.)</p>
