<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Do you think they have yesterday&apos;s daily news?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Why?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Oh my God. (Grabs Phoebe and turns her away) Phoebe. Don&apos;t look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Where? (Turns to face him) Ooh, come to Momma.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> He&apos;s coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.</p>
<p>(The guy walks past them)</p>
<p><strong>Guy:</strong> Nice hat.</p>
<p><strong>Monica and Phoebe:</strong> (in unison) Thanks.</p>
<p>(The guy walks on)</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> We should do something. Whistle.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> We are not going to whistle.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Come on, do it.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> No!</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Do it!</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> No!</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Why did I &apos;woo-hoo&apos;? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he&apos;d turn round and say &apos;I love that sound, I must have you now&apos;?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> I just wish there was something we could do. (Bends down and talks to him) Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Phoebe, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Maybe nobody&apos;s tried this.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he&apos;s a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he&apos;s artistic.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Okay, he&apos;s a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Oh! And, he&apos;s the kinda guy who, when you&apos;re talking, he&apos;s listening, y&apos;know, and not saying &apos;Yeah, I understand&apos; but really wondering what you look like naked.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> I wish all guys could be like him.</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> I can&apos;t believe you said woowoo. I don&apos;t even say woowoo.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh, she&apos;s coming up! She&apos;s coming up! (Turns on the TV)</p>
<p><strong>Jay Leno:</strong> (on TV) Folks, when we come back we&apos;ll be talking about her new book, &apos;Euphoria Unbound&apos;: the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.</p>
<p>(Everyone has settled down to watch, except Chandler)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Y&apos;know, we don&apos;t have to watch this. <em>Weekend At Bernie&apos;s</em> is on <em>Showtime</em>, <em>HBO</em>, and <em>Cinemax</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> No way, forget it.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> C&apos;mon, she&apos;s your mom!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Exactly. <em>Weekend At Bernie&apos;s</em>! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom&apos;s books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Yeah, well, you wouldn&apos;t think it was cool if you&apos;re eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of &apos;Mistress Bitch.&apos;</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> C&apos;mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she&apos;s a blast.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> You can say that because she&apos;s not your mom.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Oh, please...</p>
<p>(Rachel opens the door to Paolo)</p>
<p><strong>Paolo:</strong> Bona sera.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh, hi sweetie. (They kiss)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Last night.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Ah, so then his plane didn&apos;t explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Hey hey hey! She&apos;s on!</p>
<p><strong>Paolo:</strong> Ah! Nora Bing!</p>
<p><strong>Jay Leno:</strong> (on TV) ...Now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in London? What is that all about?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Your mom was arrested?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Shhh, busy beaming with pride.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Bing:</strong> (on TV) ...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I&apos;ve been intimate with a man...</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Now why would she say that&apos;s embarrassing?</p>
<p><strong>All:</strong> Shhh.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Bing:</strong> (on TV) ...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> THAT&apos;S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!</p>
<p><strong>Jay Leno:</strong> (on TV) Alright, so now you&apos;re doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Bing:</strong> (on TV) Oh, fine. I&apos;m leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love...</p>
<p><strong>All:</strong> Awww!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.</p>
<p><strong>Jay Leno:</strong> (on TV) Y&apos;know, don&apos;t take this wrong, I-I just don&apos;t see you a-as a mom, somehow.. I don&apos;t mean that, I don&apos;t mean that bad...</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Bing:</strong> (on TV) Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.</p>
<p>(The gang turn to look at Chandler)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> ...And then he burst into flames.</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Let&apos;s see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.</p>
<p>[Next is a shot of them dragging an enormous plant into the room, then Monica knitting a sweater, then Phoebe singing, then Phoebe shaving him and chatting to Monica]</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Please God don&apos;t let it be Kung Pow Chicken.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Bing:</strong> Oh, you watched the show! What&apos;d you think?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (Entering) What is this dive? Only you could&apos;ve picked this place.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Bing:</strong> Oooh, c&apos;mon, shut up, it&apos;s fun. Gimme a hug. (They both sit down) Well, I think we&apos;re ready for some tequila.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> I know I am.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Bing:</strong> Who&apos;s doing shots?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> I&apos;m in.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Bing:</strong> There y&apos;go. Ross?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Uh, I&apos;m not really a shot drinking kinda guy.</p>
<p>(Enter Rachel and Paolo. They are both somewhat flustered)</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Hi! Sorry- sorry we&apos;re late, we, uh, kinda just, y&apos;know, lost track of time.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> ...But a man can change. (Downs a shot)</p>
<p>[Time lapse. Ross is now clearly drunk. He is holding up a shot glass to his eye like a jeweller&apos;s eye.]</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Anyone want me to appraise anything?</p>
<p>(Rachel feeds something to Paolo. He eats it and licks her hand)</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I&apos;ve read everything you&apos;ve ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Bing:</strong> Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>[Cut to Mrs. Bing on the telephone.]</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Bing:</strong> Yeah, any messages for room 226?</p>
<p>(Ross emerges from a toilet marked &apos;Chicas&apos;)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Bing:</strong> You okay there, slugger?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Yeah, I&apos;m fine, I&apos;m fine. (A woman emerges from the toilet behind him and he tries to pretend he was in the other one)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Bing:</strong> What is with you tonight?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Bing:</strong> (To phone) Okay, thank you. (To Ross) It&apos;s the Italian Hand-Licker, isn&apos;t it.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> No. It&apos;s the one he&apos;s licking.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Bing:</strong> She&apos;s supposed to be with you.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> You&apos;re good.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Bing:</strong> Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y&apos;know why?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Bing:</strong> No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C&apos;mon, the guy&apos;s a secondary character, a, y&apos;know, complication you eventually kill off.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> When?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Bing:</strong> He&apos;s not a hero. ...You know who our hero is.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Bing:</strong> No, it&apos;s you!</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Please.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Bing:</strong> No, really, c&apos;mon. You&apos;re smart, you&apos;re sexy...</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Bing:</strong> You are gonna be fine, believe me.</p>

<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p>(Ross drags Joey into the hall and slams the door)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn&apos;t tell... (Joey shakes his head) Okay, &apos;cause I&apos;m thinking- we don&apos;t need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Right. No big deal.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> What code?</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> You don&apos;t kiss your friend&apos;s mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin&apos; aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!</p>
<p>(Chandler opens the door and startles them. He picks up the paper)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> What are you guys doing out here?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Yeah, well, you don&apos;t have your racket.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> No, no I don&apos;t, because it&apos;s being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Yeah, well you didn&apos;t call and leave your grip size.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. (Goes back inside and shuts the door)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Okay, I&apos;m scum, I&apos;m scum.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Ross, how could you let this happen?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> I don&apos;t know, God, I... well, it&apos;s not like she&apos;s a regular mom, y&apos;know? She&apos;s, she&apos;s sexy, she&apos;s...</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> You don&apos;t think my mom&apos;s sexy?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Well... not in the same way...</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> I&apos;ll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it&apos;s easy giving birth to seven children?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Okay, I think we&apos;re getting into a weird area here...</p>

<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Do they wait for me to do this?</p>
<p>(Joey and Ross go into Monica and Rachel&apos;s apartment)</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> So are you gonna tell him?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Why would I tell him?</p>

<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Then she came back with &quot;The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> &apos;Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn&apos;t say &quot;When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> That makes more sense.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> So, what&apos;s going on now?</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> I dunno, I&apos;ve been standing here spelling it out for you! (Goes back to the door) I don&apos;t hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. (Looks through the spyhole)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Whaddya see?</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Hard to tell, they&apos;re so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They&apos;re walking away... they&apos;re walking away... No, no they&apos;re not, they&apos;re coming right at us! Run! Run!</p>
<p>(Joey runs off down the hall. Ross tries Monica and Rachel&apos;s apartment, but it is locked so he has to stand in the hall and pretend he wasn&apos;t listening. Chandler and his mom come out)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Bing:</strong> You okay, kiddo?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Yeah, okay.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Bing:</strong> Alright. (Kisses him)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Nice save.</p>
<p>(She walks down the hall)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (Very politely) Mrs. Bing.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Bing:</strong> Mr. Geller.</p>
<p>(She leaves)</p>
<p>(Ross knocks on Monica and Rachel&apos;s door)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> You mean that?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Yeah, why not. (They shake hands) So I told her.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Yeah? How&apos;d it go?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Awful. Awful. Couldn&apos;ta gone worse.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Well, howdya feel?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Pretty good! I told her.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Well, see? So, maybe it wasn&apos;t such a bad idea, y&apos;know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? (Wags his finger at Chandler, then puts it down) But.. we don&apos;t have to go down that road.</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he&apos;s not &apos;reaching for her heaving beasts&apos;.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> What&apos;s a &apos;niffle&apos;?</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> You usually find them on the &apos;heaving beasts&apos;.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Alright, alright, so I&apos;m not a great typist...</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Wait, did you get to the part about his &apos;huge throbbing pens&apos;? Tell ya, you don&apos;t wanna be around when he starts writing with those!</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Alright, that&apos;s it! Give it back! That&apos;s it!</p>
<p><strong>All:</strong> Nooo!</p>
