<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> (entering) Hi guys!</p>
<p><strong>All:</strong> Hey, Pheebs! Hi!</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Hey. Oh, oh, how&apos;d it go?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said &apos;We should do this again!&apos;</p>
<p><strong>All:</strong> Ohh. Ouch.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> What? He said &apos;we should do it again&apos;, that&apos;s good, right?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Uh, no. Loosely translated &apos;We should do this again&apos; means &apos;You will never see me naked&apos;.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Since when?</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Since always. It&apos;s like dating language. Y&apos;know, like &apos;It&apos;s not you&apos; means &apos;It is you&apos;.</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> And everybody knows this?</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Yeah. Cushions the blow.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Yeah, it&apos;s like when you&apos;re a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> That&apos;s funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Uh, Ross.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> What? Wh- hello? The Millners&apos; farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> &quot;So how does it feel knowing you&apos;re about to die?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> &quot;Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you&apos;ll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Hey, that was really good!</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Thanks! Let&apos;s keep going.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Okay. &quot;So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> &quot;I just wanna go back to my cell. &apos;Cause in my cell, I can smoke.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> &quot;Smoke away.&quot;</p>
<p>(Joey takes out a pack of cigarettes and a lighter.  He fumbles and drops the lighter.  Then he lights a cigarett, takes a drag, and coughs.)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Relax your hand!</p>
<p>(Joey lets his wrist go limp.)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Not so much!</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Whoah!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Hey!</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Hey!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Alright, now try taking a puff.</p>
<p>(Joey tries and visibly winces.)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> It&apos;s fine, it&apos;s fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.</p>
<p>(Joey reluctantly gives him the cigarette.)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Don&apos;t think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that&apos;s been missing from your hand. When you&apos;re holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Y&apos;miss it?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. (Takes a puff.) Oh.. my.. God. (He continues to smoke.)</p>
<h4 id="scene-central-perk-everyone-except-phoebe-and-rachel-is-there">[Scene, Central Perk, everyone except Phoebe and Rachel is there.]</h4>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> No, no, no. They say it&apos;s the same as the distance from the tip of a guy&apos;s thumb to the tip of his index finger.</p>
<p>(The guys stretch out their fingers.)</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> That&apos;s ridiculous!</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Can I use.. either thumb?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> (carrying a tray of drinks) Alright, don&apos;t tell me, don&apos;t tell me! (Starts handing them out.) Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I&apos;m getting pretty good at this!</p>
<p><strong>All:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, excellent.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> (leaving to serve others) Good for me!</p>
<p>(The gang swaps all the drinks for what they ordered as Phoebe enters.  She sits down without saying hi.)</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Y&apos;okay, Phoebe?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Yeah- no- I&apos;m just- it&apos;s, I haven&apos;t worked- It&apos;s my bank.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> What did they do to you?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> It&apos;s nothing, it&apos;s just- Okay. I&apos;m going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Easy.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> - and there&apos;s five hundred extra dollars in my account.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Oh, Satan&apos;s minions at work again...</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Yes, &apos;cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> What are you talking about? Keep it!</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> It&apos;s not mine, I didn&apos;t earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Okay. Okay, let&apos;s say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I&apos;d hear, with every step I took? &apos;Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.&apos; And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- &apos;Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine&apos;...</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> We&apos;re with you. We got it.</p>
<p>(Chandler leans over the back of the couch out of sight.)</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Okay. I&apos;d- just- I&apos;d never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Chandler, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> (puling him up) Hey. Whaddya doing?</p>
<p>(Chandler tries to shrug nonchalantly but eventually he has to exhale a mouthful of smoke.)</p>
<p><strong>All:</strong> Oh! Oh, God!</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> What is this?!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> I&apos;m smoking. I&apos;m smoking, I&apos;m smoking.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Oh, I can&apos;t believe you! You&apos;ve been so good, for three years!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> And this- is my reward!</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Okay, so this time I won&apos;t quit!</p>
<p><strong>All:</strong> Ohhh! Put it out!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> All right! I&apos;m putting it out, I&apos;m putting it out. (He drops it in Phoebe&apos;s coffee.)</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Oh, no! I- I can&apos;t drink this now!</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Alright. I&apos;m gonna go change, I&apos;ve got a date.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> This Alan again? How&apos;s it goin&apos;?</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Let&apos;s see, today&apos;s Monday... Never.</p>
<p><strong>All:</strong> Oh, come on! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> No. Not after what happened with Steve.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Look, I don&apos;t even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Well, then can we meet him?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Nope. Schhorry.</p>
<h4 id="scene-iridium-monica-and-paula-are-at-work">[Scene: Iridium, Monica and Paula are at work.]</h4>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they&apos;re all over him. I mean, they&apos;re like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.</p>
<p><strong>Paula:</strong> Listen. As someone who&apos;s seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I&apos;ll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they&apos;re your friends, they&apos;re just looking out after you.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> I know. I just wish that once, I&apos;d bring a guy home that they actually liked.</p>
<p><strong>Paula:</strong> Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> (shouts to Chandler) Chandler? Do you promise to be good?</p>
<p>(Chandler makes a &apos;Cross my heart&apos; sign.  It starts to rain and he taps on the window.)</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!</p>
<p>(Chandler sulkilty picks up a garbage can lid and uses it as an umbrella.)</p>
<p>(Phoebe enters, walks to the couch, sits down, and begins to read a letter without saying hi.)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Hey, Pheebs.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> &apos;Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars.

<p>(Silence.)</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> C&apos;mon!</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> ...I&apos;ll go. Let&apos;s start with the way he kept picking at- no, I&apos;m sorry, I can&apos;t do this, can&apos;t do this. We loved him.</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> From the nursery rhyme. &apos;There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...&apos;</p>
<p>(Dubious pause.)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> ...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y&apos;know, it.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Really!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Oh, yeah. I&apos;d marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I&apos;m gonna be doing that at parties, right? (Does the impression)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> You know what I like most about him, though?</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> ..I dunno, a little too Alan?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Well, no. That&apos;s impossible. You can never be too Alan.</p>
