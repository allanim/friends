<p><strong>All:</strong> Whoooaa!</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> That&apos;s my sister.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women&apos;s room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Pheebs, what about you?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Oh... Milwaukee.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Um... Ross?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Disneyland, 1989, &apos;It&apos;s a Small World After All.&apos;</p>
<p><strong>All:</strong> No way!</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh come on, I already went.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> You did not go!</p>

<p><strong>Joey:</strong> We have a winner!</p>
<p>[Time lapse, Ross and Rachel are talking, Joey is on the couch, and Monica and Phoebe are out of the room.]</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn&apos;t have a line.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> There, well, see? Barry wouldn&apos;t even kiss me on a miniature golf course.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Come on.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (sarcastically) And you didn&apos;t marry him because...?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Probably. But you know, I&apos;ll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Yeah right.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you&apos;re left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there&apos;s all that other good stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> (sigh) OK.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> But, um... I don&apos;t think that&apos;s going to be you.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> You don&apos;t.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Really?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Mmmm.</p>

<p><strong>Ross:</strong> I do.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh Ross, you&apos;re so great. (she playfully rubs his head and gets up)</p>

<p><strong>Joey:</strong> It&apos;s never gonna happen.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (innocently) What?</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> You and Rachel.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (acts surprised) What? (pause) Why not?</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you&apos;re in the <strong>friend zone</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> No, no, no. I&apos;m not in the zone.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Ross, you&apos;re mayor of the zone.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> I&apos;m taking my time, alright? I&apos;m laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Priesthood! Look Ross, I&apos;m telling you, she has no idea what you&apos;re thinking. If you don&apos;t ask her out soon you&apos;re going to end up stuck in the zone forever.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> I will, I will. See, I&apos;m waiting for the right moment. (Joey looks at him) What? What, now?</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Yeeeeaaaahhh! What&apos;s messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You&apos;ve just got to go up to her and say, &apos;Rachel, I think that...&apos; (Rachel comes into the room behind them)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Shhhh!</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> What are you shushing?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> We&apos;re shushing... because... we&apos;re trying to hear something. Listen. (everyone is silent) Don&apos;t you hear that?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Ahhhh!</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> See?</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> No, you are not. We tell you stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in.

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.</p>
<p><strong>Jill:</strong> Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. (she kisses him on the cheek) See ya.</p>
<p>(She leaves. Chandler presses his face to the glass door after her, stroking the window lovingly. He then turns to the security camera and starts talking to it.)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Hi, um, I&apos;m account number 7143457. And, uh, I don&apos;t know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.</p>
