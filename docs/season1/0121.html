<p><strong>Joey:</strong> How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> I have no idea. But look how much they spent!</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> I know. It&apos;s just such reckless spending.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> I think when someone steals your credit card, they&apos;ve kind of already thrown caution to the wind.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> That&apos;s me.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Oh! The yuk! Ross, he&apos;s doing it again! (Points to a lamp which is shaking behind the sofa)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back- (Marcel runs toward Rachel&apos;s room) come here, Marcel-</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh no, not in my room! I&apos;ll get him.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Ross, you&apos;ve got to do something about the humping.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> What? It&apos;s, it&apos;s just a phase.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Well, that&apos;s what we said about Joey...</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Would you all relax? It&apos;s not that big a deal.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> (Out of shot) Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> What?</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> This woman&apos;s living my life.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> She&apos;s living my life, and she&apos;s doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I&apos;m intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> You&apos;re not an artist.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don&apos;t.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh, Monica, c&apos;mon, you do cool things.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Oh really? Okay, let&apos;s compare, shall we.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> (Yawning) Oh, it&apos;s so late for &apos;Shall we&apos;...</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> (Yawning) Nooo...</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> This is so unfair! She&apos;s got everything I want, and she doesn&apos;t have my mother.</p>
<h4 id="scene-central-perk-joey-and-chandler-are-discussing-stage-names">[Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Chandler are discussing stage names.]</h4>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> How about Joey... Pepponi?</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that&apos;s more neutral.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Joey... Switzerland?</p>
<p>(The waitress brings their coffee.)</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Plus, y&apos;know, I think it should be Joe. Y&apos;know, Joey makes me sound like I&apos;m, I dunno, this big. (Waitress looks at him funny) Which I&apos;m not.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Well, it does not ring a bell with me...</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> (Writes it down) Joe Stalin. Y&apos;know, that&apos;s pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Might wanna try Joseph.</p>
<p>(Joey visibly thinks &apos;Of course!&apos; and writes it down.)</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Joseph Stalin. I think you&apos;d remember that!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.</p>
<h4 id="scene-monica-and-rachels-monica-is-there-as-phoebe-and-rachel-enter">[Scene: Monica and Rachel&apos;s, Monica is there as Phoebe and Rachel enter.]</h4>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Hi. (On the phone) Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I&apos;m taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> (Hushes her) Alright, great. Thanks a lot. (Hangs up) I&apos;m going to tap class.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> This woman&apos;s got my life, I should get to see who she is.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Go to the post office! I&apos;m sure her picture&apos;s up! ...Okay, Monica, y&apos;know what, honey, you&apos;re kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> This is madness. It&apos;s madness, I tell you, <strong>for the love of God, Monica, don&apos;t do it</strong>!! ...Thank you.</p>
<h4 id="scene-a-tap-class-the-girls-are-standing-at-the-door">[Scene: A Tap Class, the girls are standing at the door.]</h4>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> What d&apos;you think?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Lotsa things.</p>
<p>(They go in and sit down.)</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Which one do you think she is?</p>
<p>(The teacher comes up to them.)</p>
<p><strong>Teacher:</strong> May I help you?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Oh, no thanks, we&apos;re just here to observe.</p>
<p><strong>Teacher:</strong> You don&apos;t observe a dance class. You <strong>dance</strong>a dance class. Spare shoes are over there.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> What does she mean?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> I think she means (Imitates) &apos;You <strong>dance</strong>a dance class&apos;. Oh, c&apos;mon, c&apos;mon. (They put on some spare shoes)</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Okay, d&apos;y&apos;see anybody you think could be me?</p>
<p><strong>Teacher:</strong> (To the class) People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let&apos;s not have that happen again!</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> She could be you.</p>
<p>(Music starts)</p>
<p><strong>Teacher:</strong> Let&apos;s get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...</p>
<p>(Everyone starts to dance in unison. Monica flounders)</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Okay, I&apos;m not getting this!</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> (Dancing in a swirly, Phoebe kind of way) I&apos;m totally getting it!</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?</p>
<p>(Rachel taps into view; she is in perfect sync with the rest of the class)</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> What? You just click when they click.</p>
<p><strong>Teacher:</strong> Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.</p>
<p>(The girls are unsure how to pair off. Phoebe settles it)</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I&apos;m with Rachel.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Great. It&apos;s gym class all over again.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe and</strong> <strong>Rachel:</strong> Aww.</p>
<p><strong>Teacher:</strong> Well that&apos;s all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Why don&apos;t I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.</p>
<p>(She starts to walk very slowly toward the front of the room. The teacher grabs her hand and pulls her. Suddenly a woman bursts in)</p>
<p><strong>Woman:</strong> It&apos;s okay, it&apos;s okay, I&apos;m here, I&apos;m here. Sorry I&apos;m late, okay, here I am. Who&apos;s the new tense girl?</p>
<p><strong>Teacher:</strong> She&apos;s your partner.</p>
<p><strong>Woman:</strong> Hi. I&apos;m Monica.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I&apos;m Mo- ...nana.</p>
<p><strong>Woman:</strong> (Fake Monica) Monana?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Yeah. It&apos;s Dutch.</p>
<p><strong>Fake Monica:</strong> You&apos;re kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam. (Asks her something in Dutch)</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.</p>
<p><strong>Teacher:</strong> And we&apos;re dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight...</p>
<h4 id="scene-central-perk-ross-is-entering">[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is entering.]</h4>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (Mortified) Hi.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler and</strong> <strong>Joey:</strong> Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Where&apos;ve you been?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> At the vet.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> She&apos;s not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> She says Marcel&apos;s humping thing&apos;s not a phase. Apparently he&apos;s reached sexual maturity.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> (To Chandler) Hey! He beat ya.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> She says as time goes on, he&apos;s gonna start getting agressive and violent.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> So what does this mean?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> I&apos;m gonna have to give him up.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>
<h4 id="scene-central-perk-scene-continued-from-earlier--they-guys-are-sitting-there-like-the-three-monkeys">[Scene: Central Perk, scene continued from earlier.  They guys are sitting there like the Three Monkeys.]</h4>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> I can&apos;t believe it, Ross. This sucks!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> I don&apos;t get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> I know. I know. I mean, one day, he&apos;s this little thing, and before you know it, he&apos;s this little thing I can&apos;t get off my leg.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Isn&apos;t there any way you can keep him?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> No, no. The vet says unless he&apos;s in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,&apos; he&apos;s just gonna get vicious. I&apos;ve just gotta get him into a zoo.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> How do you get a monkey into a zoo?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> I know that one! ...No, that&apos;s Popes into a <em>Volkswagen</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Well, we&apos;re applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y&apos;know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y&apos;know, he&apos;s out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that&apos;s a possibility.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Yeah, but that&apos;s like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it&apos;s a total party zoo.</p>
<p>(Phoebe, Monica, and Rachel enters.)</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Hey. We found her, we found the girl.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Did you call the cops?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Nope. We took her to lunch.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She&apos;s a stealer.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Y&apos;know what? After you&apos;re with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> ...Take off their hats!</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Popes in a <em>Volkswagen</em>! ...I love that joke.</p>
<h4 id="scene-monica-and-rachels-monica-rachel-and-fake-monica-are-there">[Scene: Monica and Rachel&apos;s, Monica, Rachel and Fake Monica are there.]</h4>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> No way. No way did you do this.</p>
<p><strong>Fake Monica:</strong> Monana was very brave.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!</p>
<p><strong>Fake Monica:</strong> So once they caught on to the fact that we&apos;re, y&apos;know, short and have breasts...</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> ...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don&apos;t know. Don&apos;t wait up. (Exits)</p>
<p><strong>Fake Monica:</strong> Oh, by the way, tomorrow we&apos;re auditioning for a Broadway show.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> &apos;Scuse me?</p>
<p><strong>Fake Monica:</strong> There&apos;s an open call for Cats. I&apos;m thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Nononononono. Think who you&apos;re dealing with here. I mean, I&apos;m not like you. I-I can&apos;t even stand in front of a tap class.</p>
<p><strong>Fake Monica:</strong> Well, that&apos;s just probably &apos;cause of your Amish background.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Fake Monica:</strong> Well, you&apos;re Pennsylvania Dutch, right?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.</p>
<p><strong>Fake Monica:</strong> I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see <em>Dead Poets&apos; Society</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>Fake Monica:</strong> I thought that movie was so incredibly... <strong>boring</strong>. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can&apos;t be in the play? What was that?! It&apos;s like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, &apos;Now, that&apos;s two hours of my life that I&apos;m never getting back.&apos; And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend <em>Mrs. Doubtfire</em>.</p>
<h4 id="scene-monica-and-rachels-tiem-lapse--everyone-but-joey-and-monica-are-there">[Scene: Monica and Rachel&apos;s, tiem lapse.  Everyone but Joey and Monica are there.]</h4>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (Reading letters) Oh God. (To Marcel) We didn&apos;t get into Scranton. (To the others) That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don&apos;t know who this is harder on, me or him.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> I&apos;d say that chair&apos;s taking the brunt.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh, somebody will.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> (entering) You know there already <strong>is</strong> a Joseph Stalin?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> You&apos;re kidding.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You&apos;d think you would&apos;ve known that!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Y&apos;know, you&apos;d think I would&apos;ve.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> ...Flame Boy.</p>
<h4 id="scene-central-perk-ross-is-talking-to-dr-baldhara-a-zookeeper">[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is talking to Dr. Baldhara, a zookeeper.]</h4>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Where exactly is your zoo?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Baldhara:</strong> Well, it&apos;s technically not a zoo per se, it&apos;s more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Baldhara:</strong> Does he, uh, fight with other animals?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> No-no, he&apos;s, he&apos;s very docile.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Baldhara:</strong> Even if he were... cornered?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Well I, I don&apos;t know. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Baldhara:</strong> Uh, how is he at handling small objects?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> He can hold a banana, if that&apos;s whatcha mean...</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Baldhara:</strong> How about a hammer, or a small blade?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Why- why- why would he need a blade?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Baldhara:</strong> Well, if he&apos;s up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you&apos;ve got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it&apos;s just cruel.</p>
<p>(Chandler and Joey burst in, with Marcel)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler and</strong> <strong>Joey:</strong> He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> ...He&apos;s in.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> He&apos;s in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Baldhara:</strong> You&apos;re making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego&apos;s all well and good, but if you give him to me, I&apos;ll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Nope. Going to the <em>Big Apple Circus</em> today.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Okay Monica, what are you doing? You&apos;re gonna lose your job! This is not you!</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> No, it is me! Y&apos;know, I&apos;m not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y&apos;know, when I&apos;m with her, I am so much more than that. I&apos;m- I&apos;m Monana!</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Because... I&apos;m Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> I want you to know, it wasn&apos;t me who turned you in.</p>
<p><strong>Fake Monica:</strong> Oh. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn&apos;t for you, I would never have gotten to sing <em>Memories</em> on the stage at the <em>Wintergarden Theater</em>!</p>
<p><strong>Fake Monica:</strong> Well, actually, you only got to sing &apos;Memo-&apos;.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> I just can&apos;t believe you&apos;re in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who&apos;s gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who&apos;s gonna take me to the <em>Big Apple Circus</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Fake Monica:</strong> Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you&apos;re worried about who&apos;s gonna take you to the <em>Big Apple Circus</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Well, not... worried, just... wondering.</p>
<p><strong>Fake Monica:</strong> There&apos;s nothing to wonder about, Monica. You&apos;re gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that&apos;s who you are.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Not necessarily...</p>
<p><strong>Fake Monica:</strong> Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it&apos;s the Amish thing.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Um, I&apos;m not actually Amish.</p>
