<p>(Ross goes over to the counter. Chandler follows him.)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> You&apos;re okay there?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> I can&apos;t belive you two had sex in her dream.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> I&apos;m sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else&apos;s subconscious.</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Hello Rachel.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Get off.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> (points at Joey&apos;s pen) Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> I don&apos;t know. What are you wearing?</p>
<p>(Chandler, Monica and Phoebe looks at him)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Pirates again?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this &quot;massage-yourself-at-home-workshop.&quot; And they are.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> (sarcasticly) Thanks Joey, that&apos;s a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> What... I could, I could do it. What is it?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. (Ross looks at her.) It&apos;s a whole big boob story.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> I could be a secretary.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Well, you know Phoebs. I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> I could do that.</p>
<p>(Ross&apos;s beeper goes off)</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> What are you playing with?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Oh, it&apos;s my new beeper.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. &apos;Help, come quick, they&apos;re still extinct.&apos;</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> No, it&apos;s for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> All right, I&apos;ll see you guys later. (raises)</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Off to see young Ethan?</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> When we were?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Okay, he&apos;s a senior in college.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> College?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> No, of course not. It&apos;s not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.</p>
<p><strong>All:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Oh, I can&apos;t pass for 22?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Well, maybe 25-26.</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Could tonight be the Night?</p>

<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Services? (Ross looks at him) Oh, services.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (on phone) Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that&apos;s right. That&apos;s right, JUMBO with a U, sir. (pause) No, belive me, you don&apos;t want me. Judging by his number, I&apos;d be a huge disappointment. (pause) All rightie, bye bye.</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> How was that possible?</p>
<p><strong>Young Ethan:</strong> Well, think about it. It&apos;s always on the news. &apos;A man is being held up, at gunpoint.&apos; &apos;Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.&apos; And I just kept thinking: why does people continue to go there? (He checks his watch.) Oh, ah. I should go.</p>
