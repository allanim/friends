<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh! That&apos;s why. (Rachel checks behind her ear, and finds a cinamon stick.) I&apos;m sorry!</p>
<p>(She takes the pencil out of Monica&apos;s coffee and Monica puts her cup down in disgust.)</p>

<p><strong>Woman:</strong> Chandler.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Mrs. Tedlock. You&apos;re looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a <strong>very</strong> flattering sleeve length on you.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Tedlock:</strong> Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. (Chandler tries to hide a rubber chicken from the woman.) Nothing.</p>
<h4 id="scene-central-perk-everyone-is-there-but-chandler-phoebe-runs-in-excitedly">[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there but Chandler. Phoebe runs in, excitedly.]</h4>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Hey you guys! Chandler&apos;s coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...</p>
<p>(Chandler comes in.)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Hey!</p>
<p><strong>All:</strong> Hey!</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Never mind. But it was going to be really good.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> What&apos;s going on?</p>
<p><strong>All:</strong> What is it?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> So, it&apos;s a typical day at work. I&apos;m inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.</p>
<p><strong>All:</strong> That&apos;s great!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> So.... I quit.</p>
<p><strong>All:</strong> Why?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Yeah, Chandler... you&apos;ve been there for five years.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> If I took this promotion, it&apos;d be like admitting that this is what I actually do.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> So was it a lot more money?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> It doesn&apos;t matter. I just don&apos;t want to be one of those guys that&apos;s in his office until twelve o&apos;clock at night worrying about the WENUS.</p>
<p>(Everyone looks at him, confused.)</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> ... the WENUS?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> (sarcastic) Oh. That WENUS.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> So what&apos;re you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> I don&apos;t know. That&apos;s the thing. I don&apos;t know what I want to do. I just know I&apos;m not going to figure it out working there.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? (pause) Anyway, he&apos;s opening up a restaurant and he&apos;s looking for a head chef.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> (taps Phoebe on her shoulder) Um... hi there.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Hi! (turns back to Chandler, then to Monica) Oh, yeah, no, I know. You&apos;re a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler&apos;s the one who needs a job right now, so....</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Yeah... I just don&apos;t have that much cheffing experience. Unless it&apos;s an all-toast restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> (to Monica&apos;s tapping) Yeah, yeah!</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Well, what kind of food is he looking for?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he&apos;s looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> (excited) Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Yeah, I know! (turns to Chandler) So, what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don&apos;t really see myself in a big white hat.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> OK. (pause) Oh Monica! Guess what!</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Can you see my nipples through this shirt?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> No. But don&apos;t worry, I&apos;m sure they&apos;re still there.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. (pause) I added the &quot;a-gogo.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Career counselor?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> I don&apos;t!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Hey, you guys <strong>in the living room</strong> all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don&apos;t have a dream.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Ah, the lesser-known &quot;I don&apos;t have a dream&quot; speech.</p>
<p>(Monica enters, excited.)</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Oh, I love my life, I love my life!</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Ooh! <em>Brian&apos;s Song</em>!</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> The meeting with the guy went great?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> So great! He showed me where the restaurant&apos;s going to be. It&apos;s this, it&apos;s this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> So anyway, I&apos;m cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can &apos;ooh&apos; and &apos;ahh&apos; and make yummy noises.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> What are you going to make?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> (as though Rachel wasn&apos;t paying attention) Yummy noises.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> (pause) And Monica, what are <strong>you</strong> going to make?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> I don&apos;t know. I don&apos;t know. It&apos;s just going to be so great!</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Ooh! I know what you could make! (runs over to join Monica and Rachel in the kitchen) I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? (Monica doesn&apos;t know.) You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don&apos;t know. (sits down)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> How about Tony&apos;s? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it&apos;s free.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you&apos;re not dating a puma?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Who are you going out with?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Oh, is this the bug lady?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> (trying to sound like a bug) Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Her name is Celia. She&apos;s not a bug lady. She&apos;s curator of insects at the museum.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> So what are you guys going to do?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I&apos;d introduce her to my monkey.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> And he&apos;s <strong>not</strong> speaking metaphorically.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> (aside to Ross) So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... (gestures with hands, back and forth) huh-huh?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Well, I don&apos;t know.... (gestures) huh-huh.... but I&apos;m hoping (gestures) huh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> I&apos;m telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She&apos;s going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it&apos;ll seal the deal.</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> (to Joey) OK, try this salmon mousse.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> (tasting) Mmmm. Good.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Is it better than the other salmon mousse?</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> It&apos;s creamier.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Yeah, well, is that <strong>better</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> I don&apos;t know. We&apos;re talking about whipped fish, Monica. I&apos;m just happy I&apos;m keeping it down, y&apos;know?</p>
<p>(Chandler kicks the door closed, angrily. His clothes are askew, he looks beat.)</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> My God! What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? (he taps the results and reads them) &quot;You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> That&apos;s so great! &apos;Cause you already know how to do that!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Can you believe it? I mean, don&apos;t I seem like somebody who should be doing something really <strong>cool</strong>? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> (comes up and rubs him on the chest) Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> (brings a plate of tiny appetizers over) Here you go, maybe this&apos;ll cheer you up.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I&apos;d better split this with you.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> It&apos;s supposed to be that small. It&apos;s a pre-appetizer. The French call it an <em>amouz-bouche.</em></p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> (tastes it) Well.... it is amouz-ing...</p>
<p>(Phone rings. Monica answers it.)</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, hi Wendy! (Listens) Yeah, eight o&apos;clock. (Listens) What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... (Listens) OK, great. (Listens) All right, I&apos;ll see you then. Bye. (hangs up)</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Ten dollars an hour for what?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she&apos;d help me out.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> (hurt) Waitressing?</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Uh-oh.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> But, but?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> But, you see, it&apos;s just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy&apos;s more of a... professional waitress.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh! I see. And I&apos;ve sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> You know, I don&apos;t mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in &apos;76. (dead silence) <em>Amouz-bouche</em>? (holds out tray)</p>

<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn&apos;t a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> (sarcastic) Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don&apos;t think I&apos;m the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> What&apos;s the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I&apos;ll tell you what. Just try something on me.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (deadpan) Please be kidding.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you&apos;d like to be doing right now.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> OK. (closes eyes) I&apos;m in my apartment...</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> (on phone) Hey Mr. Kostelic! How&apos;s life on the fifteenth floor? (Listens) Yeah, I miss you too. (Listens) Yeah, it&apos;s a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? (Listens) Well, that&apos;s very generous (Listens) er, but look, this isn&apos;t about the money. I need something that&apos;s more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... (Listens) And that&apos;s on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier?
