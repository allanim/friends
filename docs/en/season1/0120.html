<p><strong>Ross:</strong> I can&apos;t believe it! He&apos;s looking right at us!</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh, that is so sick.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> I feel violated. And not in a good way.</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn&apos;t have to play any games...</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> So have you called her yet?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? (The girls make disgusted noises.) It&apos;s the next day! How needy do I want to seem? (To the guys) I&apos;m right, right?</p>
<p><strong>Joey and Ross:</strong> Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> I can&apos;t believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Oh, God, just do it! (Grabbing the phone.) Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. (Calls her, then hurriedly hangs up.) I got her machine.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Her answer machine?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> So, uh, why didn&apos;t you say anything?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase &quot;Yes indeedy-o.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Look look! It&apos;s Rachel and Barry. No, don&apos;t everybody look at once!</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Okay, okay, what&apos;s going on?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Okay, they&apos;re just talking...</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> No, no actually, he&apos;s smiling.. and... Oh my God, don&apos;t do that!!</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> What? What? What?!</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! (Rachel enters.) Oh!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> (bluffing) And basically, that&apos;s how a bill becomes a law.</p>
<p><strong>All:</strong> Oh!... Right!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Hey Rach!</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> How&apos;d it go?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Y&apos;know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the <em>Russian Tea Room</em>, and I had that chicken, where y&apos;know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Not a good day for birds...</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Then we took a walk down to <em>Bendall&apos;s</em>, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of <em>Chanel</em>...</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> That&apos;s nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y&apos;know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> That&apos;s, that&apos;s nice twice!</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Rachel, what&apos;s going on? I mean isn&apos;t this the same Barry who you left at the altar?</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Duh, where&apos;ve you been?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn&apos;t, like, Orthodontist Guy, y&apos;know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?</p>
<p>(Ross &apos;prompts&apos; Chandler by hitting him on the arm.)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Yes!</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Why?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> I have my reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Okay, how about the fact that he&apos;s engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it&apos;s stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> (on phone, reading from a script) Oh, Danielle! I wasn&apos;t expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. (Rattles some dishes) Bye-bye. (Hangs up.) Oh God!</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> <strong>That&apos;s</strong> what you&apos;ve been working on for the past two hours?!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Hey, I&apos;ve been honing!</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> What was with the dishes?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y&apos;know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven&apos;t been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> (looking out the window) Look look! He&apos;s doing it again, the guy with the telescope!</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Oh my God! (Walks to the window) Go away! (Gesturing.) Stop looking in here!</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Great, now he&apos;s waving back.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can&apos;t do stuff!</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> What kinda stuff?</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Will you grow up? I&apos;m not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I&apos;m cooking naked.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> You cook naked?</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.</p>
<p>(A pause as they look at Chandler.)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> What are you looking at me for? I didn&apos;t know that.</p>

<p><strong>Barry:</strong> No, it was. It was very very good.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Well, what about Mindy?</p>
<p><strong>Barry:</strong> Oh, way, way better than Mindy.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?</p>
<p><strong>Barry:</strong> Well, if you want, I&apos;ll just&#x2014;I&apos;ll just break it off with her.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don&apos;t do that. Not, I mean not for me.</p>
<p><strong>Bernice:</strong> (over intercom) Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.</p>
<p><strong>Barry:</strong> (into intercom) Thanks, Bernice. (To Rachel) Let&apos;s go away this weekend.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..</p>
<p><strong>Barry:</strong> We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would&apos;ve liked it.</p>
<p>(Pause as Rachel realises...)</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> I had a bra.</p>
<p>(Barry finds it draped on a cupboard and gives it to Rachel, they kiss as Bobby enters.)</p>
<p><strong>Bobby:</strong> Hey, Dr. Farber.</p>
<p>(Rachel and Barry quickly split and pretend Barry is examining Rachel&apos;s mouth.)</p>
<p><strong>Barry:</strong> All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we&apos;re starting to see some real progress here.</p>
<p>(Bobby looks on, deadpan.)</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.</p>
<p>(Chandler dials his own phone and it rings.)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Yes, it&apos;s working! Why isn&apos;t she calling me back?</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Maybe she never got your message.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Y&apos;know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn&apos;t get her messages yet.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Y&apos;don&apos;t think that makes me seem a little...</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> ...desperate, needy, pathetic?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.</p>
<p>(He calls and quickly hangs up.)</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> How many beeps?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> She answered.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Y&apos;see, this is where you&apos;d use that &apos;hello&apos; word we talked about.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> I&apos;m not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I&apos;m needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.</p>
<p>(Rachel enters.)</p>
<p><strong>All:</strong> Hey! Hi!</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> How&apos;d he take it?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Pretty well, actually... (Wandering into the kitchen.)</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> (wandering in after her) Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh, do I?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> (in a low voice) We ended up having sex in his chair.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> You had <strong>sex</strong> in his <strong>chair</strong>?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn&apos;t I?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> You-you had what?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Sex in his chair.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> What, uh... what were you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> I don&apos;t know! I mean, we still care about each other. There&apos;s a history there. &apos;S&apos;like you and Carol.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Please. If she said to you, &quot;Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now,&quot; what would you say?</p>
<p>(Ross flounders.)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> If it helps, I could slide over.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> It&apos;s, it&apos;s, it&apos;s, uh, a totally diferent situation! It&apos;s, it&apos;s apples and oranges, it&apos;s, it&apos;s orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (leaving) I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?</p>
<p>(Ross exits, a phone rings, and Chandler dives for his phone.)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Hello? Hello?</p>
<p>(Rachel picks up their phone and the ringing stops.  As she talks on the phone, an elaborate visual gag is spun out which is too difficult to describe in words.)</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> (on phone) Hello?(Listens) Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? (Listens) Yes, yes, I&apos;ve heard, congratulations, that is so great. (Listens) Really? (Listens) Oh.

<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Second date!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> ...I dunno.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> You <strong>don&apos;t know</strong>?!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?</p>
