<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Well, if you&apos;re gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for.</p>

<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Rach, did you proofread these?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Uh... yeah, why?</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> You know, I can&apos;t believe you. Linda is so great! Why won&apos;t you go out with her again?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> I don&apos;t know.</p>

<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> We&apos;re not&#x2014;we&apos;re not saying anything.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> And then he did.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it&apos;s poker, so only guys can play?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> No, women are welcome to play.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y&apos;know, like... alright, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> There just don&apos;t happen to be any women in our games.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Yeah, we just don&apos;t happen to know any women that know how to play poker.</p>
<p><strong>Girls:</strong> Oh, yeah, right.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Really.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> I mean, that&apos;s a typical guy response.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Excuse me, do any of <strong>you</strong> know how to play?</p>
<p><strong>Girls:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> But you could teach us.</p>
<p><strong>Guys:</strong> No.</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> (teaching) OK, so now we draw cards.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> So I wouldn&apos;t need any, right? Cause I have a straight.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh, good for you!</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Congratulations!</p>
<p>(Microwave timer goes off. Monica gets up.)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> OK Phoebs, how many do you want?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can&apos;t&#x2014;you can&apos;t do...</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here! (gives it to Phoebe)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> No, no. Uh... no, see, uh, you-you can&apos;t do that.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that&apos;s OK, I don&apos;t need them. I&apos;m going for fours.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Oh, you&apos;re... (gives up)</p>
<p>(Monica comes back to the table with plates of food.)</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Alright, here we go. We&apos;ve got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe and Rachel:</strong> OOooooo!</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what&apos;re you doin&apos;? This is a poker game. You can&apos;t serve food with more than one syllable. It&apos;s gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...(look of realization)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> (changing subject) OK, so at this point, the dealer...</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let&apos;s play for real. High stakes... big bucks...</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn&apos;t look happy...</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> But... I&apos;m ready, so, just deal.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. (holds up two cards) Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. (Joey is unamused) Alright babe, deal the cards.</p>
<p>(Time lapse.)</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> (throws down her cards) Dammit, dammit, dammit!</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> (to Joey): Oh I see, so then, you were lying.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> About what?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> About how good your cards were.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Heh... I was <strong>bluffing</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> OK, sorry to break up this party, but I&apos;ve got resumes to fax before work tomorrow... (gets up to leave)</p>
<p><strong>Guys:</strong> Whoa, whoa, whoa!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Settle what?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh. Right.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> You know what, you guys? It&apos;s their first time, why don&apos;t we just forget about the money, alright?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Hell no, we&apos;ll pay!</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> And you know what? We want a rematch.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Well that&apos;s fine with me. Could use the money.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> (to Ross): So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (pause)...Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Yes, and I get my ya-yas from <em>Ikea</em>. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you&apos;re gonna play poker with me, don&apos;t expect me to be a &apos;nice guy,&apos; OK? Cause once those cards are dealt... (claps hands three times)</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> (pause)...Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> I&apos;m <strong>not</strong> a nice guy.</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Oh, did you get that from the &apos;I Love Rachel&apos; pizzeria?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> You still on that?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? (mimicking): &quot;When I play poker, I&apos;m not a nice guy!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> You are way off, pal.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> No, I don&apos;t think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Um.... no. See, I might&apos;ve had feelings for her at one time&#x2014;not any more. I just&#x2014;I...</p>
<p>(Marcel makes a screeching noise in background.)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?</p>
<p>(Marcel puts a CD in the player.)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OK&#x2014;if you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble.</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Ha. Ha, ha.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You&apos;re black.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Please! I am not as bad as Ross.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh, I beg to differ. The <em>Pictionary</em> incident?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> That was <strong>not</strong> an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oooooh. (reads letter) (surprised): Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> You&apos;re kidding! Where? Where?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> (in disbelief): Sak&apos;s... Fifth... Avenue.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Oh, Rachel!</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Oh, it&apos;s like the mother ship is calling you home.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Well, what&apos;s the job?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!</p>
<p>(Knock on door.)</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. (opens door) Hi!</p>
<p><strong>Aunt Iris:</strong> Is Tony Randall dead?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> I don&apos;t think so.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Why?</p>
<p><strong>Aunt Iris:</strong> Well, he may be now, because I think I hit him with my car.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Really?</p>
<p><strong>Aunt Iris:</strong> No! That&apos;s bluffing. Lesson number one. (walks into kitchen) Let me tell you something... everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap. (to Phoebe): Nice earrings.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Thank y... (thinks about it)</p>
<p><strong>Aunt Iris:</strong> Girls, sit down.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that&apos;s Rachel...</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> That&apos;s alright, I&apos;ll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break &apos;em up with a movie.</p>

<p><strong>Ross:</strong> You got me.</p>
<p>(Monica and Phoebe get up and start celebrating in the kitchen, pouring wine and singing. Rachel, shocked, goes to join them.)</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> (to Ross): Ahhh, that&apos;s alright. Y&apos;know, that&apos;s a tough hand to beat.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> (to Ross): I thought we had them!</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Oh, well, when you don&apos;t have the cards, you don&apos;t have the cards, you know. (looks at Rachel) But, uh... look how happy she is. (smiles)</p>
<p>(Chandler and Joey look at her, and then look back at him. They dive for Ross&apos;s hand to see what he had, and he tries to stop them from looking.)</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> <em>Airplane</em>! <em>Airport</em>! <em>Airport &apos;75</em>! <em>Airport &apos;77</em>! <em>Airport &apos;79</em>!</p>
<p>(Timer goes off.)</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh, time&apos;s up.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> (pointing at the drawing, upset) Bye... bye... <strong>BIRDIE</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Oh!</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> <strong>That&apos;s</strong> a bird?</p>
<p>(Monica glares at Phoebe.)</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> That&apos;s a <strong>bird</strong>!</p>
<p>(Monica sits, Rachel gets up.)</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> OK, OK, it&apos;s my turn. (reads the answer)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Go.</p>
<p>(Rachel starts drawing what looks like a bean.)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Uh.... bean! Bean!</p>
<p>(Rachel begins tapping the picture of the bean frantically.)</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> (triumphantly) <em>The Unbearable Likeness of Being</em>!</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Yes!</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> <strong>That</strong>, you get? <strong>That</strong>, you get?</p>
<p>(Monica picks up a glass to take a drink, everyone ducks as though she was about to throw it.)</p>
