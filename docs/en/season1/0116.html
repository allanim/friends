<p><strong>Joey</strong>: There&#x2019;s the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?</p>
<p>(Ursula spins around looking puzzled, quite unable to tell where the sound is coming from.)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: It&#x2019;s Phoebe! Hi!</p>
<p>(Ursula notices Joey waving his hand, and comes over.)</p>
<p><strong>Ursula</strong>: Hi. Okay, will that be all?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>Ursula</strong>: Yeah, um, I was over there, then you said, &quot;Excuse me, hello Miss,&quot; so now I&#x2019;m here.</p>
<p><strong>Joey</strong>: No, no... how come you are working here?</p>
<p><strong>Ursula</strong>: Right, yeah, &#x2019;cause its close to where I live, and the aprons are really cute.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Can we start over?</p>
<p><strong>Ursula</strong>: Yeah. Okay great. I&#x2019;m gonna be over here. (She wanders away.)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler and Joey</strong>: No, no, no!</p>

<p><strong>Ross</strong>: I don&#x2019;t know whether he&#x2019;s testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, &quot;supposedly&quot; by accident.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel</strong>: No, yeah, I&#x2019;ve done that.</p>
<p><strong>Ross</strong>: And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel</strong>: I&#x2019;ve never done that.</p>
<p>(Outside in the street, Joey and Chandler arrive, to peer through the window at Phoebe, by bending down to look underneath the shop&#x2019;s sign&#x2014;a large steaming cup of coffee.)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: All right, now look at her and tell me she doesn&#x2019;t look exactly like her sister.</p>
<p><strong>Joey</strong>: I&#x2019;m sayin&#x2019; I see a difference.</p>

<p><strong>Joey</strong>: I don&#x2019;t care. Phoebe&#x2019;s Phoebe. Ursula&#x2019;s... hot!</p>
<p>(Joey and Chandler come indoors.)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?</p>
<p><strong>Joey</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Let&#x2019;s not do that any more.</p>
<p>(They hang up their coats and scarves, then approach their friends on the main sofa.)</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>: Hey guys! Hey!</p>
<p><strong>Joey</strong>: Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: Ooh, ooh, fun! Okay... um, Liam Neeson.</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: Rift&#x2019;s. Yeah, I know.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Oh, you do? Because she said you guys haven&#x2019;t talked in like years.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: Hmmm? Yeah. So, um, is she fat?</p>
<p><strong>Joey</strong>: Not from where <strong>I</strong> was standin&#x2019;.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: (Turning to Chandler) where were you standing?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel</strong>: Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just don&#x2019;t get along?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: It&#x2019;s mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it... later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like &quot;yeah, right, well what else is new?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Ross</strong>: Oh, Pheebs, I&#x2019;m sorry, I&#x2019;ve got to go. I&#x2019;ve got Lamaze class.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Oh, and I&#x2019;ve got Earth Science, but I&apos;ll catch you in Gym.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel</strong>: So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?</p>
<p><strong>Ross</strong>: No, Susan&#x2019;s gonna be there too. We&#x2019;ve got dads, we&#x2019;ve got lesbians, the whole parenting team.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel</strong>: Well, isn&#x2019;t, isn&#x2019;t that gonna be weird?</p>
<p><strong>Ross</strong>: No, no. (Distractedly putting on a jacket to go out) I mean, it mighta been at first, but by now I, I think I&#x2019;m pretty comfortable with the whole situation.</p>
<p><strong>Monica</strong>: Ross, that&#x2019;s <strong>my</strong> jacket.</p>

<p><strong>Susan</strong>: Like lovers.</p>
<p><strong>Ross</strong>: You know how close women can get.</p>
<p>(The teacher smiles, but her eyebrows go up. Susan and Carol pat each other affectionately.)</p>
<p><strong>Carol</strong>: Susan and I live together.</p>
<p><strong>Ross</strong>: Although I was married to her.</p>
<p><strong>Susan</strong>: Carol, not me.</p>
<p><strong>Ross</strong>: Err, right.</p>
<p><strong>Carol</strong>: It&#x2019;s a little complicated.</p>
<p><strong>Ross</strong>: A little.</p>
<p><strong>Susan</strong>: But we&#x2019;re fine.</p>
<p><strong>Ross</strong>: Absolutely. (Turns back to the woman next to him.) So, twins... hah! That&#x2019;s like two births. (He struggles again.) Ouch.</p>

<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: And (he imitates the buzzer) to you too, Helen.</p>
<p><strong>Helen</strong>: (Over the intercom) Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Oh, okay. Send her in.</p>
<p>(He hurriedly checks his hair in his computer screen, before taking a sporting trophy from a drawer to place ostentatiously on his desk. An attractive young woman opens the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Nina</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Hi, Nina. Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>Nina</strong>: You wanted to see me?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Uh, Yes. Yes. I&#x2019;ve just been going over your data here, and little thing, you&#x2019;ve been post-dating your Friday numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Nina</strong>: Which is bad, because?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.</p>
<p><strong>Nina</strong>: Your... excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: WENUS. (Coughs) Weekly Estimated Net...</p>
<p><strong>Nina</strong>: Oh, Net Usage Statistics, right. Gotcha, gotcha. Won&#x2019;t happen again. I wouldn&#x2019;t want to do anything to hurt your... &quot;wenus.&quot;</p>
<p>(Nina beams flirtatiously at Chandler, who catches her drift, but for once he&#x2019;s lost for something to say &#x2013; so she nods her head to tell him that he&#x2019;s thinking correctly...)</p>

<p><strong>Ross</strong>: It doesn&#x2019;t matter. You don&#x2019;t dip your pen in the company ink.</p>
<p>(Marcel scampers about, interfering with the neatness.)</p>
<p><strong>Monica</strong>: Ross, your little creature&#x2019;s got the remote again.</p>
<p><strong>Ross</strong>: Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote...</p>
<p>(Marcel points the remote at Monica&#x2019;s television, pressing a particular combination of keys. The logo SAP appears on the screen, and suddenly the dialogue is dubbed into Spanish.)</p>
<p><strong>Monica</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>Ross</strong>: Relax, I&#x2019;ll fix it.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel</strong>: (Looking at the television) Cool... &quot;Urkel&quot; in Spanish is &quot;Urkel.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Ross</strong>: (looking at the remote) How did he do this?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: (Looking out at the balcony) So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?</p>
<p>(Rachel slowly spins around, finally noticing that the lights have outstayed their welcome.)</p>
<p><strong>Monica</strong>: Ah no, you see, <strong>someone</strong> was supposed to take them down around New Year&#x2019;s... but obviously <strong>someone</strong> forgot.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel</strong>: Well, <strong>someone</strong> was supposed to write &quot;Rach, take down the lights&quot; and put it on the re... frigerate... (finally noticing Monica&#x2019;s note stuck to the refrigerator) How long has that been there?</p>
<p>(Joey enters, looking extremely pleased with himself.)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Hey, where you been?</p>
<p><strong>Joey</strong>: I went back to Riff&#x2019;s. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna melt<a href="#%20toasted%20tuna%20sandwich">t</a> and four plates of curly fries.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Score.</p>
<p><strong>Joey</strong>: She is so hot!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err... (he indicates Phoebe, who is helping Ross understand the remote control.)</p>
<p><strong>Joey</strong>: Pheebs?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: (Jumping up) Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Joey</strong>: You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: Why? Why would you wanna... do that?  Why?</p>
<p><strong>Joey</strong>: So that if we went out on a date, she&#x2019;d be there.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: Well, I mean, I&#x2019;m not my sister&#x2019;s, you know, whatever, and um... I mean, it&#x2019;s true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, we&#x2019;ve grown apart, so, um... I don&#x2019;t know, why not? Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Joey</strong>: Cool, thanks.</p>
<p>(He happily gestures at Chandler that there was nothing to worry about, then exits. Rachel and Monica are concerned for poor Phoebe, who slides back down next to Ross.)</p>
<p><strong>Ross</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: Yeah I&#x2019;m fine.</p>
<p><strong>Ross</strong>: You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?</p>

<p><strong>Mr. Douglas</strong>: You&#x2019;re kidding? She seems so...</p>
<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Oh, no, no. Nina... (miming fairies twinkling around his head) ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Douglas</strong>: That&#x2019;s unbelievable.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Douglas</strong>: I see. I guess you never really know what&#x2019;s goin&#x2019; on inside a person&#x2019;s head.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Well, I guess that&#x2019;s why they call it psychology, sir.</p>
<p>(Mr. Douglas screws up his eyes, trying to credit what Bing has just said, but turning to follow Nina down the corridor, he realises Bing must be telling the truth, since he would not have any personal interest in the girl, would he?)</p>

The teacher is showing her class a video, which is about to end.]</h4>
<p><strong>Soothing male voice</strong>: ..a sound Mom and Dad never forget. For this after all, is the miracle of birth.</p>
<p><strong>Teacher</strong>: Lights please? And that&#x2019;s having a baby. Next week is our final class.</p>
<p>(People start getting up. Ross grabs Carol&#x2019;s doll to hold it upside down like a football, slapping it with his other hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Ross</strong>: Susan, go deep.</p>
<p>(Susan just glares back, as Ross&#x2019;s inappropriate joke falls flat. Meanwhile, a bubble is about to burst...)</p>
<p><strong>Carol</strong>: This is impossible. It&#x2019;s just impossible.</p>
<p><strong>Susan</strong>: What is, honey?</p>
<p><strong>Carol</strong>: What that woman... did. I am <strong>not</strong> doin&#x2019; that. It&#x2019;s just gonna have to stay in, that&#x2019;s all, everything will be the same, it&#x2019;ll just stay <strong>in</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Ross</strong>: Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everything&#x2019;s gonna be alright.</p>
<p><strong>Carol</strong>: (screaming at Ross) Oh, what do you know?  No one&apos;s going up to you and saying, &quot;Hi, is that your nostril?  Mind if we push this <strong>pot roast through it</strong>?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Susan</strong>: Carol, Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath.</p>
<p>(Both women gulp in air. Ross looks at his &quot;football,&quot; then manipulates the head &amp; limbs back into place, until it resembles what it represents.)</p>
<p><strong>Susan</strong>: I know it&#x2019;s frightening, but, big picture. The birth part is just one day, and when it&#x2019;s over, we&#x2019;re all gonna be parents for the rest of our lives.</p>
<p>(Ross is staring blankly into space.)</p>
<p><strong>Susan</strong>: I mean, that&#x2019;s what this is all about, right? Ross? Ross?</p>

<p><strong>Ross</strong>: I&#x2019;m gonna be a father.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel</strong>: This is just occurring to you?</p>
<p><strong>Ross</strong>: I always knew I was havin&#x2019; a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel</strong>: (She comforts him too) Oh, you&#x2019;re gonna be great!</p>
<p><strong>Ross</strong>: Aw, how can you say that? I can&#x2019;t even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.</p>
<p>(Joey tires of this, so he gets up to leave.)</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: Where&#x2019;re you going?</p>
<p><strong>Joey</strong>: Out.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: With?</p>
<p><strong>Joey</strong>: (Spreading his arms wide) Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: Alright, could I just ask you one question?</p>
<p>(Joey nods his head.)</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: Have you two, you know... like... you know... you know... yet?</p>
<p><strong>Joey</strong>: Well, not that it&#x2019;s any of your business, but, no, we haven&#x2019;t, okay?</p>
<p>(Joey walks toward the door, then hesitates and turns back.)</p>
<p><strong>Joey</strong>: You meant sex, right?</p>
<p>(Phoebe buttons her lip, while the rest of the gang pretend they&#x2019;re not there.)</p>

<p><strong>Nina</strong>: Do you have a sec?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Ah, sure, Nina. What&#x2019;s up?</p>
<p><strong>Nina</strong>: I don&#x2019;t know. For the past couple days, people have been <strong>avoiding</strong> me and giving me these really strange looks.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Oh, well, ah... maybe that&#x2019;s because they&#x2019;re ah... jealous, of us.</p>
<p><strong>Nina</strong>: Maybe. But that doesn&#x2019;t explain why they keep taking my scissors.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Ah, well, maybe that&#x2019;s, ah, because you&#x2019;re getting a big raise.</p>
<p><strong>Nina</strong>: I am?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Sure, why not?</p>
<p><strong>Nina</strong>: Oh my god! (Rushing over to give him a big hug) You&#x2019;re amazing!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Oh, you don&#x2019;t know. (Presses a button.) Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder&#x2019;s raise?</p>
<p><strong>Helen</strong>: (Over the intercom) So you still want me to send her psychological profile to Personnel?</p>
<p><strong>Nina</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Helen drinks. (Insincerely) Will you marry me?</p>
<p>(Nina puts her hands on her hips, then gives Chandler a quizzical look.)</p>

<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Well, I ended up telling her everything.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel</strong>: Oh, how&#x2019;d she take it?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. (He holds up a bandaged hand.) Little tip: if you&#x2019;re ever in a similar situation, never <strong>ever</strong> leave your hand... (he mimes Nina taking her revenge) ..on the desk.</p>
<p><strong>Monica</strong>: Okay, I think I get how to do this.</p>
<p>(Monica points the remote at her TV, and punches out a key combination from the book, but the dreaded SAP logo remains and Spanish still comes forth.)</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go away? Because I can&#x2019;t, I can&#x2019;t watch.</p>
<p><strong>Monica</strong>: (Remotely turning off the television) okay, Pheebs, they&#x2019;re gone.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Monica</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: Yeah. It&#x2019;s just, you know, it&#x2019;s this whole stupid <strong>Ursula</strong> thing, it&#x2019;s...</p>
<p><strong>Rachel</strong>: Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, he&#x2019;s going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: Um, yeah. Look, I mean, I&#x2019;m not saying she&#x2019;s like <strong>evil</strong> or anything. She just, you know, she&#x2019;s always breaking my <strong>stuff</strong>. When I was eight, and I wouldn&#x2019;t let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?</p>
<p><strong>Monica and Rachel</strong>: (Wistfully, shaking their heads) No.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: Well, but that&#x2019;s what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldn&#x2019;t even <strong>talk</strong> to me any more. Because he said he didn&#x2019;t wanna be around... <strong>anything</strong> that looked like either one of us.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel</strong>: Oh... Oh, Pheebs.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...</p>
<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: You&#x2019;re not gonna lose him.</p>
<p><strong>Monica</strong>: Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Ross</strong>: No, come on, he doesn&#x2019;t know this stuff. If he knew how you felt.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: But he&#x2019;s falling in <strong>love</strong> with her.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel</strong>: Oh please, they&#x2019;ve been going out a week. They haven&#x2019;t even slept together yet, I mean, that&#x2019;s not serious.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: Okay... Okay.</p>
<p>(Monica and Ross indicate that they mean right now.)</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: Oh, okay, oh.</p>
<p>(Phoebe gets up and walks across the hallway, but the door to Chandler and Joey&#x2019;s apartment is shut. She knocks, and anxiously waits for Joey to come, but instead her identical twin sister emerges wearing one of Joey&#x2019;s shirts.)</p>
<p><strong>Ursula</strong>: (Surprised) Oh.</p>
<p>(Phoebe reels back in shock, while Ursula defiantly leans against the doorpost as though she owns the place.)</p>
<p><strong>Ursula</strong>: Yeah, um, may we help you?</p>

<p><strong>Rachel</strong>: No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... (she climbs onto the railing to reach the top of a pole) ..I&#x2019;m takin&#x2019; &#x2019;em down. Okay? Whoa! (Screams.)</p>
