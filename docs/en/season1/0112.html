<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I&apos;m saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. (pauses, listens to person on phone) Well, the meat&apos;s only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.</p>
<p>(Camera moves to Chandler, Phoebe, Ross, and Joey sitting in living room)</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Ross, did you really read all these baby books?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman&apos;s uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that! (snaps fingers)</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta. (Joey grimaces)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> And, we&apos;re done with the yogurt. (Sets yogurt down on table)</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> (softly) Sorry. (Camera pans back to Monica, still on phone)</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? (listens to Aunt Syl on phone, looks shocked) Nice talk, Aunt Syl. (in New York accent) You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?</p>
<p>(Camera pans back to group in living room)</p>
