<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Ah, y&apos;see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said &apos;co-dependent&apos;, or &apos;self-destructive&apos;...</p>
<p><strong>Shelley:</strong> Do you want a date Saturday?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Yes please.</p>
<p><strong>Shelley:</strong> Okay. He&apos;s cute, he&apos;s funny, he&apos;s-</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> He&apos;s a he?</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> ...Couldn&apos;t enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y&apos;know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> You did?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe&apos;s entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> I did.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Yeah, I think so, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Not me.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y&apos;know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> You&apos;re kidding! Did you tell her I wasn&apos;t?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> No. No, it&apos;s just &apos;cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...</p>
<p>(Joey congratulates Ross, sees Chandler&apos;s look and abruptly stops.)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> I dunno, &apos;cause you&apos;re smart, you&apos;re funny...</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Ross is smart and funny, d&apos;you ever think that about him?</p>
<p><strong>All:</strong> Yeah! Right!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> WHAT IS IT?!</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Okay, I-I d&apos;know, you-you just- you have a quality.</p>
<p><strong>All:</strong> Yes. Absolutely. A quality.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.</p>
<p>(Phone rings; Monica gets it)</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it&apos;s Paolo calling from Rome.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh my God! Calling from Rome! (Takes phone) <em>Bon giorno, caro mio.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (to Joey) So he&apos;s calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. (Showing off to Phoebe and Chandler) I&apos;m talking to Rome.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Hey dad, what&apos;s up? (Listens) Oh God. Ross, it&apos;s Nana.</p>

<p><strong>Aunt Lillian:</strong> The doctor says it&apos;s a matter of hours.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> How-how are you, Mom?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> Me? I&apos;m fine, fine. I&apos;m glad you&apos;re here. ...What&apos;s with your hair?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> What&apos;s different?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> Oh, maybe that&apos;s it.</p>
<p>(Monica strides over to Ross, who is making coffee, and talks to him aside.)</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> She is unbelievable, our mother is...</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Oh God!</p>
<p>(They hug.)</p>
<p>[Cut to the hospital, later. Everyone is talking about Nana.]</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet &apos;n&apos; Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Geller:</strong> Not just restaurants, from our house.</p>
<p>(The nurse comes out of Nana&apos;s room.)</p>
<p><strong>Nurse:</strong> Mrs. Geller?</p>
<p>(Everyone stands up. Cut to Ross and Monica in Nana&apos;s room.)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> She looks so small.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> I know.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Well, at least she&apos;s with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> G&apos;bye, Nana. (She kisses her on the forehead.)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Bye, Nana.</p>
<p>(He goes to kiss her but she moves. Monica screams. Ross shouts and stares in disbelief. Monica runs out of the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Ross!</p>
<p>(Ross runs out too.)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> What is going on?!</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Y&apos;know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she&apos;s not, quite..</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> She&apos;s not- past, she&apos;s present, she&apos;s back.</p>
<p><strong>Aunt Lillian:</strong> (reentering) What&apos;s going on?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Geller:</strong> She may have died.</p>
<p><strong>Aunt Lillian:</strong> She <strong>may</strong> have died?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Geller:</strong> We&apos;re looking into it.</p>
<p>(Monica returns with the nurse and they go into Nana&apos;s room.)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> I, uh, I&apos;ll go see. (He goes in)</p>
<p><strong>Nurse:</strong> This almost never happens!</p>
<p>(Nana passes for the second time and the nurse pulls the blanket over her. Ross and Monica go to tell the family)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> <strong>Now</strong> she&apos;s passed.</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> (exasperated) Yes, Chandler, that&apos;s exactly what it is. It&apos;s your hair.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Yeah, you have homosexual hair.</p>
<p>(Monica and Ross enter.)</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> So, um, did she...</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Twice.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Twice?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Oh, that sucks!</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> You guys okay?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> I dunno, it&apos;s weird. I mean, I know she&apos;s gone, but I just don&apos;t feel, uh...</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Maybe that&apos;s &apos;cause she&apos;s not really gone.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Nono, she&apos;s gone.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> We checked. A lot.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she&apos;s like right here, y&apos;know? (She circles her hand around her right shoulder. Chandler, sitting on her right, draws back nervously) Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y&apos;know? ...I miss her.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this? (Gives her a pencil)</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Now, see, I don&apos;t believe any of that. I think once you&apos;re dead, you&apos;re dead! You&apos;re gone! You&apos;re worm food! (realises his tactlessness) ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Y&apos;know, I dunno who this is, but it&apos;s not Debbie. (Hands back the pencil)</p>

<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> Well, that doesn&apos;t mean she can&apos;t look nice!</p>
<p>(They open a cupboard which, amongst other things, contains a chest of drawers)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> Sweetie, you think you can get in there?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (sarcastic) I don&apos;t see why not.</p>
<p>(He tries pushing against the chest of drawers. Then he opens one of the drawers and climbs into the closet using that; he falls behind the chest of drawers with a shout.)</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> You what?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Geller:</strong> I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Define fun.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Geller:</strong> C&apos;mon, you&apos;ll make a day of it! You&apos;ll rent a boat, pack a lunch...</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> ...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Geller:</strong> Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says &apos;Jack Geller, so predictable&apos;. Maybe after I&apos;m gone, they&apos;ll say &apos;Buried at sea! Huh!&apos;.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> That&apos;s probably what they&apos;ll say.</p>

<p><strong>Shelley:</strong> I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Well, yeah... &apos;s&apos;no Brian in Payroll.</p>
<p><strong>Shelley:</strong> Is Brian...?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> No! Uh, I d&apos;know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I&apos;d like to think you&apos;d set me up with someone like him.</p>
<p><strong>Shelley:</strong> Well, I think Brian&apos;s a little out of your league.</p>

<p><strong>Aunt Lillian:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.</p>
<p><strong>Aunt Lillian:</strong> You know, whatever we pick, she would&apos;ve told us it&apos;s the wrong one.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> You&apos;re right. We&apos;ll go with the burgundy.</p>

<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Okay. Um, how about these? (Holds out a pair)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> That&apos;s really a day shoe.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> And where she&apos;s going everyone else&apos;ll be dressier?</p>
<p><strong>Aunt Lillian:</strong> Could we see something in a slimmer heel?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (forages around) Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.</p>
<p><strong>Aunt Lillian:</strong> No, it really should be burgundy.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.</p>
<p>(He finds a shoebox (out of shot), pulls it down and opens it. It is full of <em>Sweet &apos;n&apos; Lo</em>&apos;s.)</p>

<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> No, I&apos;d be hearing about &apos;Why didn&apos;t I get the honey-glazed ham?&apos;, I didn&apos;t spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she&apos;d be saying &apos;Why are you wasting your money? I don&apos;t need flowers, I&apos;m dead&apos;.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> That sounds like Nana.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> Do you know what it&apos;s like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> ...I can imagine.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> I&apos;m telling you, it&apos;s a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> Tell her what?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Do you think things would have been better if you&apos;d just told her the truth?</p>
