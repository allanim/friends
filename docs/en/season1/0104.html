<p><strong>Monica:</strong> How does she do that?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> I cannot sleep in a public place.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> (waking and startling them) Oh! What what what! ...Hi.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> It&apos;s okay, y&apos;know, you just nodded off again.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> What&apos;s going on with you?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> I got no sleep last night!</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Why?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they&apos;re both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they&apos;re constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they&apos;re having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Thanks.</p>
<p>(Chandler and Joey enter.  Joey is counting his steps.)</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> ...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> You got waaaay too much free time.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> (to Ross) Hey! Here&apos;s the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we&apos;re taking you.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Happy birthday, pal!</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> We love you, man. (Kisses Ross)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Funny, my birthday was seven months ago.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> So?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> So, I&apos;m guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn&apos;t decide which one of you got to bring a date?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Well, aren&apos;t we Mr. &quot;The glass is half empty.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Oh, I was hoping you wouldn&apos;t remember.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Ohhh.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> What&apos;s wrong with the twentieth?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Today&apos;s the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship. (Joey is puzzled.) Sex. ..You know what, I-I&apos;d better pass on the game. I think I&apos;m just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> The hell with hockey, let&apos;s all do that!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> (trying to stop Ross leaving) C&apos;mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys&apos; night out, c&apos;mon, whaddya say, big guy, (Pretending to punch him in the stomach.) Huh? Huh? Huh?</p>

<p>(Rachel runs up cluching an envelope.)</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there&apos;s my name! Hi, me!</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Wow, you worked in a mine?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> I worked in a <em>Dairy Queen</em>, why?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> God, isn&apos;t this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally&#x2014;(opens envelope)&#x2014;not worth it. Who&apos;s FICA? Why&apos;s he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that.</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> We&apos;ll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women&apos;s shoes.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y&apos;know. Fact, she, uh- she never took&apos;em off, &apos;cause we-we- (off Chandler&apos;s look) Sorry. Sorry.</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> (on phone) Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? (Listens) Yes, hold on. (To Rachel) Um, they say there&apos;s been some unusual activity on your account.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> But I haven&apos;t used my card in weeks!</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> That <strong>is</strong> the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you&apos;re okay.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> They wanna know if I&apos;m okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I&apos;m okay, okay, let&apos;s see. Well, let&apos;s see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I&apos;m getting coffee! And it&apos;s not even for me! So if that sounds like I&apos;m okay, okay, then you can tell them I&apos;m okay, okay?</p>
