<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Just, &apos;cause, I don&apos;t want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It&apos;s just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Sounds like a date to me.</p>
<p>[Time Lapse]</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Alright, so I&apos;m back in high school, I&apos;m standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.</p>
<p><strong>All:</strong> Oh, yeah. Had that dream.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Then I look down, and I realize there&apos;s a phone... there.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Instead of...?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> That&apos;s right.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Never had that dream.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. And it turns out it&apos;s my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!</p>
<p>[Time Lapse, Ross has entered.]</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (mortified) Hi.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Are you okay, sweetie?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Cookie?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> (explaining to the others) Carol moved her stuff out today. (to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air just in front of Ross.)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> No, no don&apos;t! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay? I&apos;ll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she&apos;ll be very happy.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> No you don&apos;t.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> No I don&apos;t, to hell with her, she left me!</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> And you never knew she was a lesbian...</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn&apos;t know, how should I know?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Alright Ross, look. You&apos;re feeling a lot of pain right now. You&apos;re angry. You&apos;re hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?</p>
<p>(Ross gestures his consent.)</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Strip joint! C&apos;mon, you&apos;re single! Have some hormones!</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> I don&apos;t want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!</p>
<p>(Rachel enters in a wet wedding dress and starts to search the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> And I just want a million dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully.)</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Rachel?!</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren&apos;t there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!</p>
<p><strong>Waitress:</strong> Can I get you some coffee?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Hi, sure!</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Hi.</p>
<p>(They go to hug but Ross&apos;s umbrella opens.  He sits back down defeated again.)</p>
<p>(A moment of silence follows as Rachel sits and the others expect her to explain.)</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- (to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet &apos;n&apos; Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that&apos;s when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y&apos;know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering &apos;Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?&apos;. (to Monica) So anyway I just didn&apos;t know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you&apos;re the only person I knew who lived here in the city.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Who wasn&apos;t invited to the wedding.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn&apos;t be an issue...</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Now I&apos;m guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she&apos;s really not happy about it.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> (on phone) Daddy, I just... I can&apos;t marry him! I&apos;m sorry. I just don&apos;t love him. Well, it matters to me!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> (re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> I say push her down the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe, Ross, Chandler, and Joey:</strong> Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! (She is pushed down the stairs and everyone cheers.)</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> C&apos;mon Daddy, listen to me! It&apos;s like, it&apos;s like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, &apos;You&apos;re a shoe! You&apos;re a shoe, you&apos;re a shoe, you&apos;re a shoe!&apos;. And today I just stopped and I said, &apos;What if I don&apos;t wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y&apos;know? Or a- or a hat! No, I&apos;m not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I&apos;m saying I am a ha- It&apos;s a metaphor, Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> You can see where he&apos;d have trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Look Daddy, it&apos;s my life. Well maybe I&apos;ll just stay here with Monica.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Well, I guess we&apos;ve established who&apos;s staying here with Monica...</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Well, maybe that&apos;s my decision. Well, maybe I don&apos;t need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!</p>
<p>[Time Lapse, Rachel is breathing into a paper bag.]</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Just breathe, breathe.. that&apos;s it. Just try to think of nice calm things...</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> (sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> I&apos;m all better now.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> (grins and walks to the kitchen and says to Chandler and Joey.) I helped!</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y&apos;know? Independence. Taking control of your life.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> (comforting her) And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he&apos;s away a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Joey, stop hitting on her! It&apos;s her wedding day!</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> What, like there&apos;s a rule or something?</p>
<p>(The door buzzer sounds and Chandler gets it.)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Please don&apos;t do that again, it&apos;s a horrible sound.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> (over the intercom) It&apos;s, uh, it&apos;s Paul.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Buzz him in!</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Who&apos;s Paul?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Wait. Your &apos;not a real date&apos; tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> He finally asked you out?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Yes!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Rach, wait, I can cancel...</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Please, no, go, that&apos;d be fine!</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> (to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (choked voice) That&apos;d be good...</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> (horrified) Really?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (normal voice) No, go on! It&apos;s Paul the Wine Guy!</p>
<p>(There&apos;s a knock on the door and it&apos;s Paul.)</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.</p>
<p><strong>All:</strong> Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> I&apos;m sorry, I didn&apos;t catch your name. Paul, was it?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Two seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can&apos;t be good.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> So Rachel, what&apos;re you, uh... what&apos;re you up to tonight?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Right, you&apos;re not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big lizards... Anyway, if you don&apos;t feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> (deadpan) Yes, and we&apos;re very excited about it.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Well actually thanks, but I think I&apos;m just gonna hang out here tonight.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Okay, sure.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Oh, I wish I could, but I don&apos;t want to.</p>

<p>(Joey and Chandler are finishing assembling the bookcase.)</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> I have no idea.</p>
<p>(Joey checks that Ross is not looking and dumps it in a plant.)</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Done with the bookcase!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> All finished!</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (clutching a beer can and sniffing) This was Carol&apos;s favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> You guys.</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> My brother&apos;s going through that right now, he&apos;s such a mess. How did you get through it?</p>

<p><strong>Joey:</strong> What are you talking about? &apos;One woman&apos;? That&apos;s like saying there&apos;s only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There&apos;s lots of flavors out there. There&apos;s Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get &apos;em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!</p>
