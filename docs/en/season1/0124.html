<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (quietly) That would be nice.</p>
<p>(Chandler, annoyed with Ross&apos;s fawning, makes a &apos;pfft&apos; noise.)</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Pardon?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft. (walks over to where Joey is seated)</p>
<p>(Joey is looking at his check.)</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I&apos;ll pay you back.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> I will, really. I&apos;ll pay you back this time.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> (sigh)... And where&apos;s this money coming from? (gives money to Joey)</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Well... I&apos;m helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (overhearing) What kind of research?</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Oh, just, y&apos;know.... science.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Science. Yeah, I think I&apos;ve heard of that. (everyone&apos;s interest is piqued, they all look over)</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> (sigh)... It&apos;s a fertility study.</p>
<p>(Rachel laughs.)</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Oh, Joey, please tell me you&apos;re only donating your <strong>time</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Alright, come on you guys, it&apos;s not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Wow, ooh, you&apos;re gonna be making money hand over fist!</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Jeez, you say one thing, and...</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> You&apos;re going to China?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Yeah, i-it&apos;s for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don&apos;t want us to have the bone, so I&apos;m going over there to try to persuade them to give us the bo&#x2014;it&apos;s&#x2014;it&apos;s a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I&apos;m gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can&apos;t. So here&apos;s my itinerary (hands a sheet of paper to Monica). Um... here&apos;s a picture of me... (hands it to Monica)</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Oh, let me see! (takes the picture)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (to Monica): Could you take it to Carol&apos;s every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn&apos;t forget me?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p>(Phoebe puts the picture of Ross up to her face.)</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Hi, Ben. I&apos;m your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... (puts picture down, sees Ross staring at her) Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Oh no, she&apos;s out having drinks with Carl.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Oh. (pause) Hey, who&apos;s Carl?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Oh, well, see, there&apos;s this guy she met at the...</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> At the coffeehouse, right.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> So you <strong>do</strong> know who he is! (laughs, Ross stares at her) Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> OK, I&apos;m gonna go say goodbye to the guys.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Oh, hey, y&apos;know what? Tell them that bone story.</p>
<p>(Ross goes outisde on the balcony.)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Hi.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Hey!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Hey!</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (sigh)....I have to go to China.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> The country?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom&apos;s breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Uh, let&apos;s see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Well, Rachel&apos;s having drinks with him tonight.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Oh no! How can she do that when she&apos;s never shown any interest in you?!?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> <strong>Forget</strong> about her.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> He&apos;s right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Course there, they just call it food.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Yeah... I guess. I don&apos;t&#x2014;I don&apos;t know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK? (gives Chandler a gift for Rachel)</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Listen, buddy, we&apos;re just looking out for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> I know.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man. (Joey gives Ross a hug)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> I&apos;m still on my first. I just think you&apos;re nice.</p>
<p>[Time lapse. Melanie, Joey&apos;s girlfriend, is there with Joey, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel. Ross is gone.]</p>
<p><strong>Melanie:</strong> Anyway, that&apos;s when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves &apos;The Three Basketeers.&apos;</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> (sarcastic) Ooooh. (looks dumbfounded at Joey&apos;s stupidity)</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> (gets up) OK, how does everybody like their burgers?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later. (walks into living room)</p>
<p>(Everyone follows Rachel to the living room. Monica pulls Joey aside.)</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Hey, hold on there, tiger. How&apos;s it going? How you holding up?</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we&apos;re gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I...</p>
<p>(Monica rolls her eyes.)</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Then you do. Heh, heh.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> So, uh, have you ever thought about being there <strong>for her</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Y&apos;know, just be there <strong>for her</strong>.</p>
<p>(Long pause... Joey looks confused.)</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Not following you.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Think about it.</p>
<p>(They both walk over to where Rachel is opening her gifts. Rachel sees her first gift is a fruit basket.)</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> OK, I&apos;m guessing this is from...</p>
<p>(Melanie smiles.)</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Well, thank you, Melanie.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> (pointing out a gift) OK, this one right here is from me.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> (picks it up) OK... ah, it&apos;s light... (shakes it)...it rattles... it&apos;s... (opens it) <em>Travel Scrabble</em>! Oooohhh, thank you! (she gives it back to him)</p>
<p>(Chandler looks dejected. Rachel picks up another gift.)</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> This one&apos;s from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it&apos;s a book... feels like a book. And...(opens it)...it&apos;s a book!</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Oh, it&apos;s Dr. Seuss!</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> (to Rachel): That book got me through some tough times.</p>
<p><strong>Melanie:</strong> There is a little child inside this man!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he&apos;ll die.</p>
<p>(Rachel picks up the next gift.)</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Who&apos;s this from?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Oh, that&apos;s Ross&apos;s.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh... (opens it)... (sees it is a pin) Oh my God. He remembered.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Remembered what?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can&apos;t believe he remembered!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? (pats his <em>Travel Scrabble</em> game)</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Oh, it&apos;s so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> I can&apos;t believe he did this.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?</p>
<p>(Everyone looks at him. He realizes he just spilled the beans about Ross&apos;s crush on Rachel. You can hear this entire classic scene by clicking here.)</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> What did you just say?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> (panicked) ahem... um... Crystal duck.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> No, no, no.... the, um, the... &apos;love&apos; part?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> (stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin....</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh.... my God.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> (rubbing his temples) Oh, no-no-no-no-no....</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> (pats Chandler on the leg) That&apos;s good, just keep rubbing your head. That&apos;ll turn back time.</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> I mean, this is unbelievable.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> I know. This is really, really huge.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> No it&apos;s not. It&apos;s small. It&apos;s tiny. It&apos;s petite. It&apos;s wee.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Nuh-uh. I don&apos;t think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> OK, is there a mute button on this woman?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... (to Joey): W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Well, given that he&apos;s desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn&apos;t mind getting a cup of coffee or something.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Ross? All this time? Well, I&apos;ve got to talk to him. (gets up to leave)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> (quickly) H-He&apos;s in China!</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> The country.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> No, no, wait. (checks Ross&apos;s itinerary) His flight doesn&apos;t leave for another forty-five more minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> What about the time difference?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> From here to the airport?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Yes! (Rachel walks towards door) You&apos;re never gonna make it!</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Rachel, what&apos;re you gonna say to him?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> I-I-I don&apos;t know.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Well then maybe you shouldn&apos;t go.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> He&apos;s right, cause if you&apos;re just gonna, like, break his heart, that&apos;s the kind of thing that can wait.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Yeah, but if it&apos;s good news, you should tell him now.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> I don&apos;t know. Maybe I&apos;ll know when I see him.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Here, look, alright, does this help?</p>
<p>(Phoebe gets up, holds the picture of Ross up to her face.)</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y&apos;know, I just, I&apos;ve just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I&apos;ll see you later. (opens door)</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> If we broke up, and I lost you...</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we&apos;re gonna break up?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven&apos;t broken up?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (pause) No. But... it only has to happen <strong>once</strong>. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> I don&apos;t know... I mean, I&apos;ve never looked at you that way before.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Well, start looking.</p>
<p>(They kiss. Ross walks away, and then fades out.)</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Carl:</strong> Exactly! And you just know I&apos;m gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Right! You&apos;re right!</p>
<p><strong>Carl:</strong> Heh... y&apos;know?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> You know what?</p>
<p><strong>Carl:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I&apos;m so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... (gives him her drink) I mean&#x2014;I&apos;m sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I&apos;m sorry.</p>
<p>(Rachel leaves.)</p>
<p><strong>Carl:</strong> But...</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> (sifting through crowd) Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.</p>
<p>[Cut to the jetway, the old man who the flight attendant delivered Rachel&apos;s message to gets off the plane, his wife still upset with him.]</p>
<p><strong>Man:</strong> For God&apos;s sake, will you let it go? There&apos;s no Rachel!</p>
<p>(A Chinese woman getting off the plane drops one of her bags. Ross gets off next.)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Oh, hey, hey, I got that.</p>
<p>(Ross picks up the bag... then he and the woman kiss.)</p>
<p><strong>Julie:</strong> Oh, thanks, sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.</p>
<p><strong>Julie:</strong> Really?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Julie:</strong> You don&apos;t think they&apos;ll judge and ridicule me?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> No, no, they will. I just... uh...</p>
<p><strong>Ross and Julie:</strong> Can&apos;t wait.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Come on, they&apos;re gonna love you.</p>
<p>[Cut to a close-up of Rachel, eagerly awaiting Ross&apos;s arrival... not knowing he is getting off the plane with another woman.]</p>
<p><strong>End</strong></p>
