<p><strong>Monica:</strong> What you guys don&apos;t understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Yeah, right!.......Y&apos;serious?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Oh, yeah!</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y&apos;know? I mean it&apos;s like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Yeah, and-and it&apos;s not that we don&apos;t like the comedian, it&apos;s that-that... that&apos;s not why we bought the ticket.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> The problem is, though, after the concert&apos;s over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y&apos;know? I mean, we&apos;re in the car, we&apos;re fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you&apos;re gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?</p>

<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like &apos;Gee, that glacier&apos;s getting kinda close.&apos; See?</p>
<p><strong>Marsha:</strong> Speaking of issues, isn&apos;t that your ex-wife?</p>
<p>(Carol, Ross&apos;s ex-wife, has entered behind them and is standing outstide the exhibit.)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (trying to ignore her) No. No.</p>
<p><strong>Marsha:</strong> Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!</p>

<p><strong>Carol:</strong> A lesbian?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Well... you never know. How&apos;s, um.. how&apos;s the family?</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Oh, I think this is the episode of Three&apos;s Company where there&apos;s some kind of misunderstanding.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong>...Then I&apos;ve already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.)</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that?</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Whose little ball of paper is this?!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn&apos;t need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead.</p>
<p>(Monica starts to fluff a pillow.)</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> She&apos;s already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you&apos;ve already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it&apos;s fine!</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Look, I&apos;m sorry, guys, I just don&apos;t wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child&apos;s pillow.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you&apos;re scaring me. I mean, you&apos;re like, you&apos;re like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Yeah, calm down. You don&apos;t see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> That&apos;s because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y&apos;see, he&apos;s the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!</p>
<p><strong>All:</strong> Eeaagh!</p>
<p>(Rachel enters from her room.)</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Has anybody seen my engagement ring?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Yeah, it&apos;s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God.... (Starts to look under the couch cushions.)</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> No, look, don&apos;t touch that!</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh, like I wasn&apos;t dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... &apos;Hi Barry! Remember me? I&apos;m the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!&apos; Oh God and now I&apos;m gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Easy Rach, we&apos;ll find it. (To all) Won&apos;t we!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler and Joey:</strong> Oh! Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Alright, when&apos;d&apos;ya have it on last?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Doy! Probably right before she lost it!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> You don&apos;t get a lot of &apos;doy&apos; these days...</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> ...Dinah?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don&apos;t be mad...</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> You didn&apos;t.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh, I am sorry...</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.)</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Now, Monica, you know that&apos;s not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> (puts down the lasagne) I just... can&apos;t do it.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Boys? We&apos;re going in.</p>
<p>(Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe start to pick through the lasagne as there&apos;s a knock on the door which Monica answers.)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (standing outside the door) .....Hi.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Wow. That is not a happy hi.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Carol&apos;s pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it!</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.)</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I&apos;m not comfortable with it, I don&apos;t have to be involved.. basically it&apos;s entirely up to me.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> She is so great! I miss her.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> What does she mean by &apos;involved&apos;?</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> So what are you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I&apos;m still gonna be a father.</p>
<p>(Joey starts to eat the rest of the lasagne and everyone turns and stares at him.)</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> .....Well, this is still ruined, right?</p>

<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> Oh, Martha Ludwin&apos;s daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What&apos;s that curry taste?</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Curry.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> Mmmm!</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> I- I think they&apos;re great! I, I really do.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Geller:</strong> (To Ross) Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn&apos;t she?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> They all had a thing for him.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Aw, Mom...</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> I&apos;m sorry, why is this girl going to call me?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don&apos;t know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> No Mom, I don&apos;t have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> Well, they don&apos;t have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.)</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> Oh, we&apos;re having spaghetti! That&apos;s.... easy.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.</p>
<p>[Time Lapse, everyone is now eating.]</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Geller:</strong> I&apos;m not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> What&apos;s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> Nothing! It&apos;s an expression.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> No it&apos;s not.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Geller:</strong> Don&apos;t listen to your mother. You&apos;re independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...</p>
<p>[Time Lapse.]</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Geller:</strong> Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I&apos;m telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.</p>
<p>[Time Lapse.]</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Geller:</strong> ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God &apos;Our Little Harmonica&apos; doesn&apos;t seem to have that problem.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what&apos;s going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here&apos;s the deal. Carol&apos;s a lesbian. She&apos;s living with a woman named Susan. She&apos;s pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.</p>
<p>(Stunned silence ensues.)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> (To Monica) And you knew about this?!</p>
<p><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>
<h4 id="scene-central-park-everyones-there">[Scene: Central Park, everyone&apos;s there.]</h4>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Your folks are really that bad, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Well, y&apos;know, these people are pros. They know what they&apos;re doing, they take their time, they get the job done.</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Boy, I know they say you can&apos;t change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I&apos;d want yours.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Must pee. (Goes to pee.)</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Y&apos;know, it&apos;s even worse when you&apos;re twins.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> You&apos;re twins?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Yeah. We don&apos;t speak. She&apos;s like this high-powered, driven career type.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> What does she do?</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> She&apos;s a waitress.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.)</p>
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Chandler, you&apos;re an only child, right? You don&apos;t have any of this.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> The lights, please..</p>
<p>(Joey turns off the lights, and they all leave as Rachel starts to clean up. Ross enters from the bathroom.)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> ...How long was I in there?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> I&apos;m just cleaning up.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> D&apos;ya.. uh.. d&apos;ya need any help?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh.. a little..</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Mm-hmm..</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> A lot.</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Mm.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> So, got any advice? Y&apos;know, as someone who&apos;s recently been- dumped?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word &apos;dumped&apos;. Chances are he&apos;s gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y&apos;know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it&apos;ll be hard. Or, y&apos;know, uh, hey!, I&apos;ll go down there, and I&apos;ll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh, you&apos;ve got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Got me.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Remember when we were in high school together?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> I mean, didn&apos;t you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that&apos;d be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross?</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Yes, yes!</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh! Man, I never thought I&apos;d be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn&apos;t have to move his hand.)</p>

<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Hi.</p>

<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Okay, that&apos;s great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I&apos;m- Oh.</p>
<p><strong>Carol:</strong> Thanks.</p>
